          <h3>Cheyenne's Story</h3>
          <p>Cheyenne was a 15-year-old Appaloosa mare living in Omaha, Nebraska, and she was sold several times during her life. Cheyenne was rescued by Carolina in February 2013. Carolina's biggest dream was to have a horse and become best friends with her. Cheyenne fulfilled this dream for Carolina and so much more. Chey taught Carolina how to ride, train, and be close with a horse.

          <h3>Kindness</h3>
          <p>Cheyenne always showed kindness and tenderness in her actions. She was gentle when walking near children and lowered her head to allow them to pet her. She was aware of her size and was cautious wherever she went, especially when carrying a rider. Her unique, personal ways of caring towards Carolina made her a once in a lifetime horse. </p>

          <h3>Love</h3>
          <p>The love between Carolina and Cheyenne was strong. Carolina cared for and loved Cheyenne despite a medical conditional called COPD. Chey required special expensive treatments and shots every month to keep her comfortable and healthy. Their love carried them through many trips to lakes, walking trails, friendships, and a marriage. Sadly, Chey passed away from this disease in April 2015. </p>

            <h2>Don't Be Shy</h2>
            <p>Chey is short for Cheyenne. She was the most beautiful, magical horse. She was loving and graceful. She loved her family as much as they cherished her. Carolina was given Cheyenne to take care of. At first, Carolina was shy with Chey. Chey taught Carolina the things she liked most such as... </p>
        <ul>
        <li>...being brushed.</li>
        <li>...getting bathes.</li>
        <li>...eating her grain.</li>
        <li>...receiving treats.</li>
        <li>...riding in the pasture.</li>
        <li>...taking pictures.</li>
        <li>...even selfies.</li>
        <li>...most of all, eating treats!</li>
        <li>After doing these favorite activities, Carolina was not shy anymore. She loved spending time with Chey. Soon after Carolina introduced Chey to Ryan, her husband. Sure enough, Ryan was told, "Don't be shy with Chey."</li>
