          <h3>Cheyenne's Story</h3>
          <p>Cheyenne was a fifteen old Appalossa mare living in Omaha, Nebraska and sold several times during her life. Cheyenne was rescued by Carolina by February 2013. Carolina's biggest dream was to have a horse and become best friends with her. Cheyenne completed this dream for Carolina and so much more. Chey taught Carolina how to ride, train, and be close with a horse.

          <h3>Kindness</h3>
          <p>Cheyenne always showed kindnes and tenderness in her actions and behavior. She was gentle when walking near children and lowered her head to allow them to pet her. She was aware of her size and was cautious wherever she went, espcially when carrying a rider. Her unique personal ways of caring towards Carolina made her the once in a lifetime type of horse and love. </p>

          <h3>Love</h3>
          <p>The love between Carolina and Cheyenne was strong. Carolina cared and loved Cheyenne despite a medical conditional called COPD. Chey required special expensive treatments and shots monthly to keep her comfortable and healthy. Their love carried them through many trips to lakes, walking trails, friendships, and a marriage. Sadly, Chey eventually passed away from this disease in April 2015. </p>

            <h2>Don't Be Shy</h2>
            <p>Chey is short for Cheyenne. She was the most beautiful, magical horse. She was loving and graceful. She loved her family as much as they cherished her.
